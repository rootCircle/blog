# Ideas that won't make you millionaire

You might have been doing something, but still you're here. Maybe some friend referred you down the road or may be it was me. I am not sure if you are coming from *the internet*, but if you do accept my honorable grace here. Down below is absolutely wasteful `[0-9]+` ideas that I had hallucinated sometimes in past/later, maybe while walking, observing things or even in the bathroom taking shower. Many of these ideas, if not all were conceptualized before pre-GPT hype era, so validity of them is something of your business.

By the way, these ideas are definitely not worth trying so if want to continue reading them, you're definitely wasting your time. So, if you are here till now, pat yourself on the back, because down here is 69 insane ideas, that I have kept in my secret diaries for long.

## 1. Manual Desktop, Laptop, Mobile Assembling
- **Problem** : X Laptop doesn't fit my specifications, maybe I need 8 GB of RAM with i7 12th CPU, but there isn't one in the market.
- **Solution** : Devise a marketplace where user can send in there requirements and we as provider can tinker or create from scratch an laptop, mobile or any desktop.
- **Party breakers** : Custom made PCs are generally expensive compared to that provided by OEMs
- **Any Providers** : [Framework Laptop](https://frame.work/) is near close for laptops in that sector.

## 2. Share your unused Internet over hotspot and earn free credits
- **Problem** : Darn, I still have more than 60% plus of my data remaining. Oh my gosh, my neighbor is so irritating, he always ask for free hotspot and doesn't bother to give any value in return.
- **Solution** : A mobile app that can share mobile hotspot and monitor bandwidth usage per device. A seed device will be transferred credits in real-time for sharing his internet with other devices. At end of the day, user will be able to convert wasted data to *use-later* data.
- **Implementation details** : Passwords change dynamically. Premium users given higher speed and more bandwidth + Free monthly data.
- **Possible Business Models** : Ads based credit generation and transaction or freemium model.
- **Any problems** : Bandwidth monitoring is difficult on non-rooted devices on Android and iPhone

## 3. Temporary Chats
- **Problem** : Hey! I want to chat with you, but I require your mobile number/username blah blah blah. No easy way to have a short communication easily.
- **Solution** : A simple website where I generate a short anonymous temporary identifier and talk to stranger safely and privately by sharing those codes.
- **Aim** : To prevent spams, scams and abuse of social medias. To keep your info on social media private and healthy and to **respect user's confidentiality**. To help prevent sharing your highly private data from being shared publicly on the internet.
- **Financial model** : Donations
- **Helpful in** : 
    1. People buying an item from social media platform from strangers. (Can be integrated with W.I.P.S. too[more on that below])
    2. For celebrity, teachers, content creators, moderators and anyone who want a bit of privacy, to engage in privacy friendly conversation with people they don't know physically.
- **Features** :
    1. Based on Random Identifier created on server.
    2. Cloud/end-to-end encrypted chats based on user choice.
    3. Support for PC, Mobile, Web etc. (more focus on web only)
    4. Minimal data collection (if necessary & required) & no third party connection (even for fonts)

    12. No support for financial transaction on this network.
    13. User choice for encryption, cloud/end-to-end based etc.
- **Also consider using** : [SimpleX Chat](https://simplex.chat/)

## 4. Solving math problems step by step
- **Problems** : I see the problem, but I don't know the intermediate steps required to solve a Maths problem.
- **Solution** : A math doubt solving & explainer with help of AI powered by Wolfram Alpha and T.T.S. service.

## 5. Wait till I Pay Service (*W.I.P.S.*)
- **Problem** : I can't trust the other person for work based on contract, if he will deliver or not, what if he defaulted?
- **Solution** : A platform where the buyer will pay the full payment for an asked service in advance, to the platform. The work can be cancelled in part/complete, anytime before expiry. Regular percentage transfer to the seller/provider based on pre-decided milestones. Platform to be used as trust bridge between seller and buyer.
- **Target Users** : Used by artists for reducing problem in their payment from owner. Also, a safe-check for owner also.
- **Any providers** : Freelancing platforms like [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/) etc.

## 6. AI powered CEO for budding tech-centered entrepreneurs
- **Problem** : Gosh, I don't even know, if my idea is validated or not and still I have distributed sizable share of my company because I didn't know **B of Business**. Help preventing equity sharing just because you need that CEO quick enough.
- **Solution** : A person that will have a close eye on the market news, stocks, geo-politics and other affecting factors as well. Learn around previous data, explore possibilities and make & explain decisions. Also, predict common human sentiments based on news-feed, etc.

## 7. Static broom that sucks dust when in proximity or contact

- **Solution** : Use vacuum, static electricity to our use to make it happen, such that dust don't just fly and spread when dusting.

## 8. Internet during Wars
- **Problem** : We don't have a war ready infra for basic internet.
- **Solution** : This basically.................(to be continued)

# More

## Technical (good for projects)

9. Cloud storage provider over P2P (using encrypted copies of file in chunks here and there, designed like a torrent). Can be used a lot in corporate settings.
10. Media streaming over P2P. Sort-of torrent, but here you stream over download.
11. Terminal based pixelated dance over a song using GPT.
12. Maven: Automatically add dependencies based on mvn url upstream.
13. Git based note taking aap. (eg: logseq etc)
14. C but in REPL (can use rust here)
15. An email protocol on top of IMAP/POP3 SMTP that respects privacy. (alt use GPG keys)
16. Non-hardcoded hello world message. (see also: obfuscated code)
17. Open voting system
18. `auto-cpufreq` in rust :evil:
19. Fingerprint Driver for my laptop for Linux. :pain:
20. Analytics tool based on feedback conciseness (generate impression based on summary of comments, rating it on five)
21. Idea simulation and feedback using GPT and real world data.
22. ML based interview scheduler and ops keeping in mind any absentees etc.
23. Using git on a folder in android, controlled using an app. (useful for logseq graphs on android)
24. Chatbot for depressed peoples. Segregated communities of people talking about menstrual pain, cultural taboos, pains and problems to find a community of alike people helping each other.
25. Decentralized pharmacy, stressing the need of privacy for end users in terms of healthcare.

30. CACHEDIR.TAG for node_modules (ref: https://bford.info/cachedir/)
31. Compiled shell scripts for guaranteeing safety and guarantee that code will run irrespective of installed apps or not. (compile the bash script in a VM with most minimal files and binary apps, and inform user about possible breakage)
32. Logseq abbreviation support plugin for short forms. Like type `<AM>` and ask to put its full form and then reuse that definition everywhere.
33. (COOL IF IMPLEMENTED) Backend server on edge device using WASM, like webcontainers probably. Where many devices come on consensus that they will host a server locally on their device, they are rewarded with some token for each hosting at fixed time. Things like JSLinux works.

## Startup 

37. GPS based box unlocking based on proximity and app triggers; Used to deliver critically sensitive items to point B.
38. Last mile delivery using voluntary working employees.
39. Full ecosystem of software for budding entrepreneurs under one roof under one name in a clean and aesthetic way, expanding based on size and repeated feedback from user. (don't show billing software, if startup is supposedly won't require it in their current stage; giving a personalized experience for all) (eg: zoho)
40. A non-alcoholic pub for underage teenagers
41. An app to let needy entrepreneurs find complementary but budding entrepreneurs. A gig like work but both user & client are startup, rather than established business. (eg: one company want a warehouse support, so instead of connecting to well established firms which might charge more, let's connect budding startup in that field). A STARTUP for STARTUP.
42. **Pre HR based Job Listing platform for startups** (applicant pay at time of registration as one time fee, for their comprehensive OAs, Communication round, Technical, Feedback and HR round -> A detailed summary is generated with a inbuilt rating system with validity of one year). The revenue generated is turn given to recruiters to preferentially hire through our platform.
    - What it solves? Spam of applicants; Rejected applications are penalized with decreased rating at discretion of company.; Reduced cost of hiring for recruiters; instead we pay them to hire talents :-) 
    - What after ratings are generated? Hiring Company will also given ratings and hiring company will hire talent with compatible rating. If company want to hire better talents, they need to pay hefty money per talent.
    - What's the difference? It's a platform where applicant don't apply for job but make a profile and relax. Compatible company come for them
    - applicant- Hey I skilled up, what now? Applicant can give repeated interview at max 3 times a month at discounted price or they can also give a interview after the validity is over for refreshing ratings.
    - applicant - Is my profile public? No; No recruiters can see your profile unless you are compatible for the job.
    - I am fit for role, will recruiters visit my profile? At first to reduce workload, the platform will only list only selected few profiles based on number of open roles, if applicant don't want to work/recruiters is not satisfied, then the platform will release more profile with a possible abuse check.
    - If you're interested in this one, please reach out to me on <dev.frolics@gmail.com>.
